        <h2> MASKING's Personality </h2>
        <p> 
            Despite her sharp gaze and rough, delinquent-like appearance, 
            <br> Masuki likes cute things and is skilled at baking cakes. 
            <br>She is a straightforward but enthusiastic girl with a passionate heart, 
            <br>and values her friendship with the other RAISE A SUILEN members. 
            <br>She can be quite playful with her bandmates, and especially likes teasing Chiyu. 
            <br>She loves cooking, as well as talking about it, and even works part-time 
            <br>at a ramen store called "Ramen Ginga".
            <br>

            <br>She is a very skilled drummer, however, when she gets too immersed, 
            <br>she tends to fluster the other band members with her difficult improvisation performances, 
            <br>which made it difficult for her to join a band previously. 
            <br>Because of her violent and impulsive playstyle, she is called a mad dog (狂犬).
